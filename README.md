<h2>C# Advanced Topics: Prepare for Technical Interviews</h2>

The listed exercises here are all written in C#. They are mostely inspired from or practice within the Advanced C# course on Udemy, by Mosh Hamedani. Some exercises are inspired by my recent completion of CS260 - Data Structures and Algorithms. During this course I explored various data structures and how to construct them, including Hashtables, Linked Lists, and Binary Trees. While the course focused on the development of C++ applications (these applications can be found in my other repositories), I also tried to develop some of these structures (and their associated algorithms) in C# as well.

The link below leads to the Udemy course that I followed and completed.
